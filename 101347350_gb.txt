#History
The college was established during the formation of Ontario's community college system 
in 1967. Colleges of Applied Arts and Technology were established on May 21, 1965. The 
college is named after George Brown, who was an important 19th-century politician and 
newspaper publisher (he founded the Toronto Globe, forerunner to The Globe and Mail) 
and was one of the Fathers of Confederation.

The college's predecessor, the Provincial Institute of Trades (PIT), was founded in 1951
 to offer apprentice training on behalf of the provincial Department of Labour. In 1952,
the PIT began operation at 21 Nassau Street in Toronto's Kensington Market and, after 
expanding with the construction of two additional buildings on the site, was offering
programs in lathing and structural steel, barbering, diesel mechanics, jewellery arts, 
watchmaking and welding by 1961. In 1962 the province opened the Provincial Institute 
of Trades and Occupations (PITO), a sister training institute, at 555 Davenport Road 
near Casa Loma.

When George Brown College was formed in 1967, it absorbed both the PIT and PITO and
 opened its Kensington and Casa Loma campuses at the two institutes' former facilities.
  George Brown College also went on to absorb, in 1969, four former Toronto Board of 
  Education Adult Education Centres in a third campus at 507 College Street and,
   in 1973, five Toronto-area Schools of Nursing in 1973, including: St. Joseph's, 
   St. Michael's, Toronto General, Atkinson (Toronto Western) and Nightingale.

In 1973, a new expanded Casa Loma campus was opened. In 1976, the St. James Campus
 opened at 200 King Street East in buildings formerly belonging to Christie Bakery
  and Hallmark Cards.

The Hospitality building (300 Adelaide E.) opened at St. James Campus in 1987, 
the same year that the College Street Campus closed. Kensington Campus closed in 1994.
