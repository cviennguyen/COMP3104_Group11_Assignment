//Advantages
Higher speed and quality of product releases. DevOps speeds up 
product release by introducing continuous delivery, encouraging
 faster feedback, and allowing developers to fix bugs in the system 
 in the early stages. Practicing DevOps, the team can focus on the quality
  of the product and automate a number of processes.

Faster responsiveness to customer needs. With DevOps, a team can react to change 
requests from customers faster, adding new and updating existing features. As a result,
 the time-to-market and value-delivery rates increase.

Better working environment. DevOps principles and practices lead to better 
communication between team members, and increased productivity and agility.
 Teams that practice DevOps are considered to be more productive and cross-skilled.
  Members of a DevOps team, both those who develop and those who operate, act in concert.

# Devops principles
Constant collaboration and communication. These have been the building blocks of DevOps
 since its dawn. Your team should work cohesively with the understanding of the needs
  and expectations of all members.

Gradual changes. The implementation of gradual rollouts allows delivery teams to release
 a product to users while having an opportunity to make updates and roll back if something
  goes wrong.

Shared end-to-end responsibility. When every member of a team moves towards one goal 
and is equally responsible for a project from beginning to end, they work cohesively 
and look for ways of facilitating other membersâ€™ tasks

Early problem-solving. DevOps requires that tasks be performed as early in the project 
lifecycle as possible. So, in case of any issues, they will be addressed more quickly.
