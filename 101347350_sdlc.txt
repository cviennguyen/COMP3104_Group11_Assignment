//Advantages
Higher speed and quality of product releases. DevOps speeds up 
product release by introducing continuous delivery, encouraging
 faster feedback, and allowing developers to fix bugs in the system 
 in the early stages. Practicing DevOps, the team can focus on the quality
  of the product and automate a number of processes.

Faster responsiveness to customer needs. With DevOps, a team can react to change 
requests from customers faster, adding new and updating existing features. As a result,
 the time-to-market and value-delivery rates increase.

Better working environment. DevOps principles and practices lead to better 
communication between team members, and increased productivity and agility.
 Teams that practice DevOps are considered to be more productive and cross-skilled.
  Members of a DevOps team, both those who develop and those who operate, act in concert.

# Devops principles
Constant collaboration and communication. These have been the building blocks of DevOps
 since its dawn. Your team should work cohesively with the understanding of the needs
  and expectations of all members.

Gradual changes. The implementation of gradual rollouts allows delivery teams to release
 a product to users while having an opportunity to make updates and roll back if something
  goes wrong.

Shared end-to-end responsibility. When every member of a team moves towards one goal 
and is equally responsible for a project from beginning to end, they work cohesively 
and look for ways of facilitating other members’ tasks

Early problem-solving. DevOps requires that tasks be performed as early in the project 
lifecycle as possible. So, in case of any issues, they will be addressed more quickly.

#The future of DevOps
Since the time DevOps entered the game, it has proved to be effective in lots of ways: 
From speeding up development processes to bringing more value along with high-quality 
products.

DevOps isn’t going anywhere, but it doesn’t stand still either. Here are three DevOps 
trends for the near future.

As more organizations migrate to the cloud, DevOps will be tightly connected with
 cloud-native security bringing changes in the way software is built, deployed, and
  operated. With SecDevOps, companies will be able to integrate security right into 
  the development and deployment workflows.
