//Advantages
Higher speed and quality of product releases. DevOps speeds up 
product release by introducing continuous delivery, encouraging
 faster feedback, and allowing developers to fix bugs in the system 
 in the early stages. Practicing DevOps, the team can focus on the quality
  of the product and automate a number of processes.

Faster responsiveness to customer needs. With DevOps, a team can react to change 
requests from customers faster, adding new and updating existing features. As a result,
 the time-to-market and value-delivery rates increase.

Better working environment. DevOps principles and practices lead to better 
communication between team members, and increased productivity and agility.
 Teams that practice DevOps are considered to be more productive and cross-skilled.
  Members of a DevOps team, both those who develop and those who operate, act in concert.
