What is DevOps?
- combines software development with IT operation creating the portmanteau 
  "DevOps"
- originated from agile software development
- shortens and creates fewer redundancies in the systems development life cycle 
  (SDLC)
- key principles of shared ownership, workflow automation and rapid feedback

CI/CD Pipeline
- CI (Continuous integration): frequent merging of small change to the main 
  branch
	- automated builds with tools to spot errors easier
- CD (Continuous Delivery): short development cycles at high speed and 
  frequency
- CD (Continuous Deployment): new features delivered frequently

Why is DevOps Important?
- brings the cohesion of autonomous teams to fast paced high demand 
  environments 
- reduces IT overhead
- improves communication across teams
	- with continuous integration there doesn't need to be a seperate team to 	  	  
      troubleshoot and fix problems
- speeds up product deployment, and makes maintenance easier
	- sped up development cycles makse innovation faster
