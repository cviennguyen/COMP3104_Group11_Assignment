# What is devops
Other than it being a cross-functional combination (and a portmanteau) of the terms 
and concepts for "development" and "operations", academics and practitioners have not
 developed a universal definition for the term "DevOps".[a][b][c][d] Most often, DevOps
  is characterized by key principles: shared ownership, workflow automation, and rapid 
  feedback.

From an academic perspective, Len Bass, Ingo Weber, and Liming Zhu—three computer
 science researchers from the CSIRO and the Software Engineering Institute—suggested 
 defining DevOps as "a set of practices intended to reduce the time between committing
  a change to a system and the change being placed into normal production, while
   ensuring high quality".[5]

However, the term is used in multiple contexts. At its most successful, DevOps is a 
combination of specific practices, culture change, and tools.
